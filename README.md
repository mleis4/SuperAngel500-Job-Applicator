### Live Application Tracker
Maintains a persistent application_status.csv file to track:

- Lead quality
- Funnel progression


## Data-Driven Insights
Displays relevant company metrics during the application process, including:

Helping you tailor messaging before sending outreach.

## Configuration
The script requires a local file named personalinfo.txt for email authentication.
Create personalinfo.txt in the root directory with:
```
your_email@example.com
your_app_password
```


- Line 1: Your email address


- Line 2: Your App Password



## Running the Application
python main.py

**Workflow:**


1. Select '1' to retrieve the next high-priority lead.


2. Input the company’s contact email.


3. The script:
    - Logs the application
    - Sends your resume automatically

4. Select '3' at any time to:
    - View conversion statistics
    - Check remaining lead count





## Status Tracking
The system manages your funnel through four stages:
```
  Applied| Initial outreach completed. 
Interview| Callback received. 
 Rejected| Application closed. 
 Accepted| Offer received.
```

## Purpose
Designed to automate the hustle — so you can focus on preparation, networking, and interviews instead of repetitive admin work.
Good luck with the applications.
